# QUICK FIX: Download These 3 Logos

## Why are they showing the same logo?
The 3 universities (UL, TU Dublin, UCD) were all using copies of the DCU logo as placeholders.
I've now deleted those incorrect files.

## FASTEST SOLUTION (2 minutes):

### Method 1: Direct Browser Download

**1. University of Limerick:**
   - Open this link in your browser: https://www.google.com/search?q=University+of+Limerick+logo+PNG&tbm=isch

### Method 2: Use These Specific Images

**University of Limerick:**
- Search result: Look for the green logo with "UNIVERSITY OF LIMERICK" text
- Should be a horizontal green logo

**TU Dublin:**
- Search result: Look for modern blue/teal logo with "TU DUBLIN" text
- Modern, contemporary design

**UCD:**
- Search result: Look for blue shield/crest with "UCD" or "UNIVERSITY COLLEGE DUBLIN"
- Traditional university crest style

## After Downloading:

1. Make sure all 3 files are saved in: `c:\Users\sanda\Desktop\vikrin sir\Supreme Overseas\public\universities\`

**Total time needed:** About 2-3 minutes to download all 3 logos manually.

This is the most reliable method since automated downloads keep getting blocked.
